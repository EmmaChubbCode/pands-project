The iris dataset was made famous by the paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems (Fischer,1936) when it was used as an example of the classification method known as Linear Discriminant Analysis. Following Fisher’s initial use of the dataset, it has since become a common dataset used in machine learning. According to Unwin & Kleinman (2021) “Since then, it has been analysed using k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, principal components, linear regression, logistic regression, random forests, naive Bayes classification, support vector machines, neural networks”.

The dataset itself is notable simple. It contains three classes of Iris flowers: Iris versicolor, Iris setosa, and Iris virginica. Each class has 50 instances, resulting in 150 instances for the entire dataset. For each instance of iris flower, the following features are recorded: petal length, petal width, sepal width, and sepal length. **
